            This is a great play design and even better execution from the Cowboys' offense. More and more coaches are looking to use pre-snap motion to scheme receivers open, and Jason Garrett did a great job of it here. 
                The return motion gives coaches a lot of options on the backside, and here it leads to a touchdown.</dd>
