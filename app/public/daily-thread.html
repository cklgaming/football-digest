            At first glance, I thought there was a lot going on here, and the title of the thread didn't exactly help. But the more clips I watched of this specific play, the more I understood the genius behind this play design. The idea is to sell the defense on the play action, rather than selling them on the run. This gets everything moving to
                the "front" side (I think?), with the running back leaking out the backside with linemen to escort him down the field. Texas executes it to perfection here, and if done the same way, shapes up to be a chunk play every time.</dd>

            This is a great play design and even better execution from the Cowboys' offense. More and more coaches are looking to use pre-snap motion to scheme receivers open, and Jason Garrett did a great job of it here. 
                The return motion gives coaches a lot of options on the backside, and here it leads to a touchdown.</dd>
